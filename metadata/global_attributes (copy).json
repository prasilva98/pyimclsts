    "summary": "The deployment of an Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) from the port of Arrifana was scheduled for the first days of the cruise. The already mentioned weather conditions delay the deployment, that took finally place between 17-19 th of September. The Light Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (LAUV Xplore-4) conducted high-resolution surveys measuring temperature and salinity between the surface and 10/50/100 m depth (according to bathymetry) during almost 36 hours of autonomy. The total number of immersion profiles is larger than 100 cycles, with 52 profiles from surface to 100 m depth and back. Special caution and safety guidelines were followed to avoid the collision with other vessels since the zone is a busy route for marine traffic.",**
